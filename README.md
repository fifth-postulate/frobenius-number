# Frobenius Number
Determine the largest number for which the Frobenius equation has no solutions

## Coin Problem
Let's say we are given coins with certain denominations. The largest number that can not be made as a linear combination of these coins is called the Frobenius number.

More information can be found on the wikipedia page on the [coin problem][problem].

## Algorithm
There is a nice algorithm by [Albert Nijenhuis][nijenhuis] which calculates the Frobenius number. It is described in the article [A Minimal-Path Algorithm for the “MoneyChanging Problem”][article].
